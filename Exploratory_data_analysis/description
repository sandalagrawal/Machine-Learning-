EDA is a crucial part of building a Machine Learning model. It involves deep analysis of the data b various libraries and visualization tools to get insights and correlation between various data columns. 
here we will look into Univariate , Bivariate and Multivariate analysis.
then we will also learn about a special library - Pandas Profiling which can make the EDA porcess easier just by using it. We get our complete analysis in an output file - 'output.html' which can be used to learn about the data.
